Preparation for Linux
---------------------

Install COBOL compiler with the following command:

```
$ sudo apt-get install open-cobol
```

Compiling and running the programs
----------------------------------

Create simple COBOL program in the `hello.cbl` file:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'Hello world!'.
    STOP RUN.
```

Compile the program with the following command:

```
$ cobc -free -x -o hello hello.cbl
```

Next, we can run the program

```
$ ./hello
```
